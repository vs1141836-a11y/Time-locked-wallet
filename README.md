# Time Locked Wallet

## Project Description

The Time Locked Wallet is a Solidity smart contract that enables users to deposit Ether with time-based withdrawal restrictions. This contract acts as a digital savings mechanism where users can lock their funds for a predetermined period, preventing impulsive spending and encouraging long-term financial planning. The contract ensures that deposited funds cannot be withdrawn until the specified unlock time has passed, providing a trustless and automated way to implement time-based financial commitments.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized financial tool that promotes responsible money management and long-term savings habits. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide users with a transparent, secure, and immutable way to commit to their financial goals without relying on traditional banking institutions or third-party custodians. The Time Locked Wallet empowers individuals to take control of their financial discipline through smart contract automation.

## Key Features

- Funds become inaccessible until the specified unlock time
- Multiple time locks per user supported

### üí∞ **Flexible Deposit System**
- Accept any amount of Ether (minimum > 0)
- Support for multiple concurrent deposits with different unlock times
- Real-time tracking of total locked balance per user

### üîì **Secure Withdrawal Mechanism**
- Automated unlock based on block timestamp
- Individual withdrawal of specific time locks
- Prevention of double withdrawals through withdrawal status tracking

### üìä **Comprehensive Tracking**
- View all time locks for any user address
- Check available (unlocked) balance
- Monitor individual time lock status and unlock times

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- Owner-only emergency withdrawal function
- Input validation and error handling
- Event logging for all major operations
- Ownership transfer capability

### üîç **Transparency**
- All time locks and balances are publicly viewable
- Event emissions for deposits, withdrawals, and emergency actions
- Open-source contract code for full auditability

## Future Scope

### üöÄ **Enhanced Features**
- **Interest Mechanism**: Implement reward systems for longer lock periods
- **Partial Withdrawals**: Allow users to withdraw portions of locked funds with penalties
- **Flexible Lock Extensions**: Enable users to extend lock periods for additional benefits

- **Mobile Application**: Develop user-friendly mobile apps for easier interaction
- **Web3 Wallet Integration**: Seamless integration with popular wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable time locks across multiple blockchain networks

### üìà **Analytics & Reporting**
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Provide detailed insights into saving patterns and behaviors
- **Goal Setting Tools**: Help users set and track financial milestones
- **Historical Performance**: Track and analyze savings progress over time
- **Community Features**: Social elements to encourage savings challenges and group goals

## Installation & Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy `TimeLockedWallet.sol` to your preferred Ethereum network
2. **Deposit Funds**: Call `depositWithTimeLock()` with desired lock duration
3. **Monitor Locks**: Use `getUserTimeLocks()` to view your time locks
4. **Withdraw**: Call `withdrawUnlockedFunds()` when funds are unlocked

## Security Considerations

- Always verify contract addresses before interacting
- Test with small amounts first
- Be aware that emergency withdrawal is controlled by the contract owner
- Lock durations are immutable once set
